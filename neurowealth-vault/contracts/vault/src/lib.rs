//! # NeuroWealth Vault Contract
//!
//! An ERC-4626 inspired vault contract for the NeuroWealth AI-powered DeFi yield platform on Stellar.
//!
//! ## Architecture Overview
//!
//! This contract implements a non-custodial vault where users deposit USDC and an AI agent
//! automatically deploys those funds across various yield-generating protocols on the Stellar
//! blockchain.
//!
//! ## Share Accounting Model
//!
//! This implementation follows an ERC-4626-inspired share-based model where:
//! - Users deposit USDC and receive vault shares representing proportional ownership
//! - Total shares remain constant while yield is accrued
//! - The value of each share increases as `total_assets` grows
//! - Withdrawals burn shares and return the user's proportional share of total assets
//!
//! Core math:
//! - `shares_to_mint = (assets * total_shares) / total_assets`
//!   - Bootstrap case: when `total_shares == 0 || total_assets == 0`, `shares_to_mint = assets`
//! - `assets_to_return = (shares * total_assets) / total_shares`
//!
//! This ensures:
//! - Automatic yield growth tracking
//! - Fair distribution of earnings
//! - Mathematically consistent deposits and withdrawals
//!
//! ## Asset Flow
//!
//! ```text
//! Deposit Flow:
//! User → [USDC Token] → [Vault Contract] → [AI Agent monitors]
//!                      ↓
//!              Balance recorded per user
//!              DepositEvent emitted
//!
//! Rebalance Flow (AI Agent):
//! AI Agent → [Vault.rebalance()] → [External Protocols (Blend, DEX)]
//!                              ↓
//!                      RebalanceEvent emitted
//!
//! Withdraw Flow:
//! User → [Vault.withdraw()] → [Vault Contract] → [USDC Token] → User
//!         ↓
//! Balance updated
//! WithdrawEvent emitted
//! ```
//!
//! ## Storage Layout
//!
//! ### Instance Storage (Contract-Wide, Expensive to Read/Write)
//! - `Agent`: The authorized AI agent address that can call rebalance()
//! - `UsdcToken`: The USDC token contract address
//! - `TotalDeposits`: Total USDC held in vault (excluding yield deployed externally)
//! - `Paused`: Boolean flag for emergency pause state
//! - `Owner`: Contract owner address for administrative functions
//! - `TvlCap`: Maximum total value locked in the vault
//! - `UserDepositCap`: Maximum deposit per user
//! - `Version`: Contract version for upgrade tracking
//!
//! ### Persistent Storage (Per-User, Cheaper)
//! - `Balance(user)`: USDC balance for each user address
//!
//! ## Event Design Philosophy
//!
//! Events are emitted for all state-changing operations to enable:
//! - AI agent to detect deposits/withdrawals and react accordingly
//! - Frontend applications to track user balances in real-time
//! - External indexers to build transaction histories
//! - Security auditors to verify contract behavior
//!
//! ## Upgrade Model
//!
//! This contract supports upgradeability through Soroban's built-in contract upgrade
//! mechanism. The owner can upgrade the contract code while preserving storage state.
//! Upgrades must be performed carefully to maintain:
//! - User balances
//! - Total deposits
//! - Agent and owner addresses
//! - Configuration parameters
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ## Deposit USDC
//! ```ignore
//! let token_client = token::Client::new(&env, &usdc_token);
//! token_client.transfer(&user, &vault_address, &amount);
//! vault_client.deposit(&user, &amount);
//! ```
//!
//! ## Withdraw USDC
//! ```ignore
//! vault_client.withdraw(&user, &amount);
//! ```
