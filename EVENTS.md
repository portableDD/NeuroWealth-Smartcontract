# NeuroWealth Vault Events

This document provides a comprehensive reference for all events emitted by the NeuroWealth Vault contract, including their topics, payload schemas, and usage patterns.

## Event Design Philosophy

Events are emitted for all state-changing operations to enable:
- AI agent to detect deposits/withdrawals and react accordingly
- Frontend applications to track user balances in real-time
- External indexers to build transaction histories
- Security auditors to verify contract behavior

## Event Topics Convention

All events use short symbol topics (max 9 characters) for efficiency:
- Topics are prefixed with abbreviated identifiers
- Payload contains detailed event data
- Events are published from the vault contract address

Canonical topics are declared in [neurowealth-vault/contracts/vault/src/lib.rs](neurowealth-vault/contracts/vault/src/lib.rs) as `TOPIC_*` constants and should be used as the single source of truth by emit sites and tests.

## Core Events

### 1. VaultInitializedEvent
**Topic:** `"init"`

Emitted when the vault is initialized with core configuration.

```rust
pub struct VaultInitializedEvent {
    pub agent: Address,        // Authorized AI agent address
    pub usdc_token: Address,   // USDC token contract address
    pub tvl_cap: i128,        // Initial TVL cap (7 decimals)
}
```

**Usage:**
- AI agents use this to discover vault configuration
- Frontend verifies initialization parameters
- Indexers record vault deployment details

### 2. DepositEvent
**Topic:** `"deposit"`

Emitted when a user deposits USDC into the vault.

```rust
pub struct DepositEvent {
    pub user: Address,    // Depositing user address
    pub amount: i128,     // Amount deposited (7 decimals)
    pub shares: i128,     // Number of shares minted
}
```

**Usage:**
- AI agents detect new deposits to deploy yield strategies
- Frontend updates user balances in real-time
- Indexers track deposit history for analytics

### 3. WithdrawEvent
**Topic:** `"withdraw"`

Emitted when a user withdraws USDC from the vault.

```rust
pub struct WithdrawEvent {
    pub user: Address,    // Withdrawing user address
    pub amount: i128,     // Amount withdrawn (7 decimals)
    pub shares: i128,     // Number of shares burned
}
```

**Usage:**
- AI agents update internal records after withdrawals
- Frontend updates user balances
- Indexers track withdrawal history

### 4. RebalanceEvent
**Topic:** `"rebalance"`

Emitted when the AI agent rebalances funds between yield strategies.

```rust
pub struct RebalanceEvent {
    pub protocol: Symbol,     // Target protocol ("blend", "none")
    pub expected_apy: i128,   // Expected APY in basis points (850 = 8.5%)
}
```

**Usage:**
- AI agents track rebalancing decisions
- Frontend displays current strategy allocation
- Indexers monitor strategy changes for risk analysis

## Administrative Events

### 5. VaultPausedEvent
**Topic:** `"paused"`

Emitted when the vault is paused by the owner.

```rust
pub struct VaultPausedEvent {
    pub owner: Address,   // Owner who triggered the pause
}
```

### 6. VaultUnpausedEvent
**Topic:** `"unpaused"`

Emitted when the vault is unpaused by the owner.

```rust
pub struct VaultUnpausedEvent {
    pub owner: Address,   // Owner who triggered the unpause
}
```

### 7. EmergencyPausedEvent
**Topic:** `"emerg"`

Emitted when the vault is emergency paused by the agent.

```rust
pub struct EmergencyPausedEvent {
    pub owner: Address,   // Agent who triggered emergency pause
}
```

### 8. LimitsUpdatedEvent
**Topic:** `"l_upd"`

Emitted when deposit limits are updated.

This canonical topic is used by both `set_limits` and `set_deposit_limits`.

```rust
pub struct LimitsUpdatedEvent {
    pub old_min: i128,    // Previous minimum deposit
    pub new_min: i128,    // New minimum deposit
    pub old_max: i128,    // Previous maximum deposit
    pub new_max: i128,    // New maximum deposit
}
```

### 9. AgentUpdatedEvent
**Topic:** `"agent"`

Emitted when the AI agent address is updated.

```rust
pub struct AgentUpdatedEvent {
    pub old_agent: Address,  // Previous agent address
    pub new_agent: Address,  // New agent address
}
```

### 10. AssetsUpdatedEvent
**Topic:** `"assets"`

Emitted when total assets are updated (yield accrual).

```rust
pub struct AssetsUpdatedEvent {
    pub old_total: i128,   // Previous total assets
    pub new_total: i128,   // New total assets
}
```

## Ownership Transfer Events

### 11. OwnershipTransferInitiatedEvent
**Topic:** `"own_init"`

Emitted when ownership transfer is initiated.

```rust
pub struct OwnershipTransferInitiatedEvent {
    pub current_owner: Address,  // Current owner address
    pub pending_owner: Address,  // Pending owner address
}
```

### 12. OwnershipTransferredEvent
**Topic:** `"own_xfer"`

Emitted when ownership transfer is completed.

```rust
pub struct OwnershipTransferredEvent {
    pub old_owner: Address,   // Previous owner address
    pub new_owner: Address,   // New owner address
}
```

### 13. OwnershipTransferCancelledEvent
**Topic:** `"own_cncl"`

Emitted when ownership transfer is cancelled.

```rust
pub struct OwnershipTransferCancelledEvent {
    pub owner: Address,              // Current owner address
    pub cancelled_pending: Address,  // Cancelled pending owner
}
```

## Protocol Integration Events

### 14. BlendSupplyEvent
**Topic:** `"blend_sup"`

Emitted when assets are supplied to Blend protocol.

```rust
pub struct BlendSupplyEvent {
    pub asset: Address,   // Asset address (USDC)
    pub amount: i128,     // Amount supplied
    pub success: bool,    // Whether supply succeeded
}
```

### 15. BlendWithdrawEvent
**Topic:** `"blend_wd"`

Emitted when assets are withdrawn from Blend protocol.

```rust
pub struct BlendWithdrawEvent {
    pub asset: Address,           // Asset address (USDC)
    pub requested_amount: i128,   // Amount requested to withdraw
    pub amount_received: i128,    // Amount actually received
    pub success: bool,            // Whether withdrawal succeeded
}
```

## Upgrade Events

### 16. UpgradedEvent
**Topic:** `"upgraded"`

Emitted when the contract is upgraded to a new WASM implementation.

```rust
pub struct UpgradedEvent {
    pub old_version: u32,   // Previous contract version
    pub new_version: u32,   // New contract version
}
```

## Event Monitoring Guide

### For AI Agents

1. **Monitor DepositEvent**: Trigger yield deployment within 5 seconds
2. **Monitor WithdrawEvent**: Update internal position tracking
3. **Monitor RebalanceEvent**: Log strategy changes for performance tracking

### For Frontend Applications

1. **Monitor DepositEvent/WithdrawEvent**: Update UI balances in real-time
2. **Monitor Pause Events**: Disable deposit/withdraw functionality when paused
3. **Monitor RebalanceEvent**: Display current strategy to users

### For Indexers

1. **All Events**: Store complete event history for analytics
2. **Deposit/Withdraw Events**: Calculate TVL and user activity metrics
3. **Rebalance Events**: Track strategy performance over time

## Event Testing

The contract includes comprehensive tests that verify:
- Each operation emits the correct event topic
- Event payload fields contain expected values
- Event emission is consistent across different scenarios

Tests will fail if:
- Event topics change unexpectedly
- Event payload fields are modified
- Required events are not emitted

## Version Compatibility

Event schemas are versioned to ensure backward compatibility:
- Adding new fields to existing events is allowed
- Removing fields requires a major version bump
- Changing field types requires a major version bump

Current event schema version: **v1**
