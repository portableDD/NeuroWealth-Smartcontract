## Good First Issues

If you're new to the project, a great place to start is our [good first issues](https://github.com/NeuroWealth/NeuroWealth-Smartcontract/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). These are typically smaller tasks that help you get familiar with the codebase.

## Reporting Issues

We use standardized issue templates to ensure that bug reports and feature requests contain all the necessary information for the team to respond effectively.

### Bug Reports

Use the [bug report template](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) when:
- You've found a defect in the smart contract
- You've encountered unexpected behavior
- You have a reproducible test case

The bug report template will guide you to provide:
- Soroban network context (devnet, testnet, or mainnet)
- Contract ID and affected function
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Test command output and environment details
- Verification checklist to ensure completeness

### Feature Requests

Use the [feature request template](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md) when:
- You want to propose a new capability
- You want to suggest an enhancement
- You have an idea for improving the project

The feature request template will guide you to provide:
- Clear feature description
- Use case and motivation
- Proposed solution and alternative approaches
- Security and network-specific considerations
- Architecture alignment
- Related issues or pull requests

### Security Issues

**For security-related issues**, please follow the [Security Policy](SECURITY.md) and report via GitHub's security advisory system instead of creating a public issue. Do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly.

### Issue Labels

We use the following labels to categorize issues:

- `bug`: Something isn't working as expected
- `enhancement`: New feature or request
- `documentation`: Improvements or additions to documentation
- `good first issue`: Good for newcomers
- `security`: Security-related issues or improvements
- `help wanted`: Extra attention needed

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

To contribute to the smart contracts, you'll need the following installed:

- **Rust**: Latest stable version. [Install Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
- **WASM Target**: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`
- **Stellar CLI**: We recommend version **21.2.0** or later.
  ```bash
  cargo install --locked stellar-cli --version 21.2.0
  ```
- **Node.js & npm**: For agent and frontend development (LTS version recommended).

### Building the Contract

Navigate to the contract directory and use the Stellar CLI to build:

```bash
cd neurowealth-vault
stellar contract build
```

### Running Tests

We prioritize high test coverage. Always run the test suite before submitting a PR:

```bash
cd neurowealth-vault
cargo test
```

For frontend or agent changes, run:
```bash
npm test
```

## CI Requirements

Our CI pipeline (defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every push and pull request. For a PR to be merged, it must pass:

1. **Format Check**: `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
2. **Clippy Lint**: `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`
3. **Tests**: `cargo test --verbose`
4. **Build WASM**: Successful build of the contract WASM.

## Coding Standards

- **Error Messages**: All error messages must follow the [Error Message Style Guide](ERROR_STYLE_GUIDE.md).
- **Architecture**: Ensure changes align with the project [Architecture Documentation](ARCHITECTURE.md).
- **Events**: Every state change should emit a corresponding event as defined in [EVENTS.md](EVENTS.md).
- **Safety**: Always use `checked_*` arithmetic operations for financial calculations.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `develop`.
2. **Make your changes**, ensuring you add or update tests.
3. **Verify locally** that all tests pass and there are no linting errors.
4. **Commit your changes** with a clear and descriptive message.
5. **Push to your fork** and open a Pull Request against the `develop` branch.
6. **Provide a detailed description** in the PR of what you changed and why.
